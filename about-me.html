                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; My name is Marek Radkov and I'm a software developer. Originally I'm from Veliko Turnovo
                    but for the past year I live in Sofia. From 2010 till 2015 I've worked as a office manager
                    in "Radkov Consult Engineering"Ltd. But until August 2014 I've never really did code
                    anything at all. It was the very next month that I started studying programing in SoftUni and
                    this is one of my best decisions ever. I really did like coding and it became a very important part
                    of my life. . .

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before SoftUni and Sofia , I studied in Veliko Turnovo. In 2014 I graduated
                    "St.Cyril and St.Methodius University of Veliko Turnovo" and got a bachelor's degree in
                    International Economic Relations :

                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What really can I say about myself? I'm an ordinary man , with ordinary life ;).
                    As you can see , I love animals and I really care about them. On the photo I'm with my best buddy -
                     Rex. I found him on the street when he was just a little puppy , but now he is fully grown , strong
                     and loving as much as he can be <3 !
                    <br/>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you ask me about hobbies , I don't think that I have one.
                    There is some things that I like to do in my spare time. I like to exercise ,
                    to keep my body in shape , go out with friend , family and not quite so often - reading
                    a good book.
                    <br/>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sometimes as every other man , I get little bit down and feel
                    the need of motivating myself. In these moments I like to read quotes said by smarter
                    and wiser men /or of course women ;)/. So I decided to make you guys one small gesture and
                    made a little "quote generator". Be my guest and click the Daily Quote button. Enjoy ! :))

                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Well what can I say. For one year me and my colleagues from
                    SoftUni learned a lot. But this is coding ,you can't learn everything and
                    if I can be fair one year is far from enough. Everything is a matter
                    of experience and of course experience comes with time. But I'm highly
                    motivated and eager to learn more!
                    <br/>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The photos that you see are only a little part of the things
                    that we did as teamwork or personal projects.And this site is one of my personal projects. I didn't put screenshots
                    of the back-end console applications.
                    <br/>
                    In SoftUni we took courses for <strong> HTML , CSS , PHP , JavaScript ,
                        C# , DataBases and more </strong> . The source code for these projects and more you can checkout
                    in my <strong>Github</strong> page: <a href="https://github.com/Mkey5">https://github.com/Mkey5</a>
                     but I don't update it very frequently, so some of the code may be altered and upgraded but not
                    uploaded ,sorry for that. For this site I used HTML5 , CSS3 , JavaScript , Jquery ,
                    Bootstrap , SASS and PHP. And I hope that I'm not the only one that likes it :D !
